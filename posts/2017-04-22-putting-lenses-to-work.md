title: Putting lenses to work

I gave a talk a couple of weeks ago at BayHac 2017 on "Putting lenses to
work", to show in a practical context how we use lenses at my workplace. I
specifically avoided any theory about lenses, or the complex types, or the
many operators, to show that at its core, lens is a truly invaluable library:

The slides for this talk are available here:

The code in the slides are taken directly (using Emacs) from a test file in
that same repository, `Lenses.hs`, to serve as a way of preserving helpful
examples, and to make it easy to cargo cult specific patterns into your code.
